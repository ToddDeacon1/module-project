    <h1>Why is Garden Warfare 2 the Best Sequel Ever?</h1>
    <h2>How the Garden Warfare Genre Became What it is.</h2>
    <p>The Garden Warfare Series was a type of game that nobody would of expected. I mean, going from a Tower Defense game to a Third Person Shooter? Nobody expected it. Even the creator of Plants VS Zombies thought it would be a bad idea. But after a couple months of work, during the Microsoft E3 2015 Conference, it was announced. Only to fully release 1 year later on Febuary 23rd, 2016.</p>
    <p>When it got released, everyone loved it. They loved the characters, it's suprisingly great gunplay, and the huge amount of replayability. So much so, that in 2015 it reached a total of 6 million players.
       So expectedly, Pop Cap were eager to make a sequel as soon as possible. And so, at E3 2015; Plants Vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2 was announced. The game was marketed as basically more Garden Warfare. Rather than reworking the first game or removing features, Pop Cap was set on improving the core aspects of the game. And most of all, adding WAY more content and quality of life features.</p>
    <p>After 8 months of more trailers and a short beta, Garden Warfare 2 was offically released on PS4, Xbox 1, and Steam. And somehow, it is even better than the first one.
       let me quickly recap what Garden Warfare is. Garden Warfare is a third person hero shooter franchise with two teams. plants, and zombies. Each character has their own abilities, weapons, different variations, and more. Now back to the second game.
        No longer, are we restricted to a home menu. But now, there is a full-on HUB WORLD that you just spawn straight into. And not only is this where you access everything you could in the first game, like different gamemodes, there is also singleplayer missions that you can progress through. Go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies:_Garden_Warfare_2 for more info about the Gamemodes, and more history behind the game.</p>
